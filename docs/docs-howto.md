# Documentation Howto

We use **[mkdocs]** for documenting the project.
The goal is to make the documentation process as simple as possible,
to allow versioning and to use pull requests for text reviews.
I should edit the docs locally, preview it in a browser and then suggest a pull request.

The amount of formatting elements is deliberately small.
Apart from wiki, we try to keep each page self contained and to minimize
interlinking between pages because it only complicates reading of the docs.

The documentation is written as a set of Markdown files within the `docs/` directory
and after deployment available as a static website: [Docs Website].


[Docs Website]: https://biggis-project.github.io/biggis-docs/
[mkdocs]: http://mkdocs.org


## Before building the docs

First of all, you need **python 3** and **pip3** to be installed.
(On some Linux distros, you need to use pip3 instead of pip)

Using pip, you need to install the following packages:

- **mkdocs** : Provides the executable command `mkdocs`.
- **mkdocs-material** : A material design theme. See also [this page](http://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).
- **pyembed-markdown** : A markdown extension that allows for embedding Youtube videos in documents.
                         See also [this page](https://pyembed.github.io/usage/markdown/).
- **mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin** : This plugin automatically generates the pages section from directory structure.
  (For more info see [this github repository](https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin))

!!! help "How to install as a user (recommended)"
    You can install the packages locally as a user into `~/.local/`
    ```sh
    pip3 install --user mkdocs
    pip3 install --user mkdocs-material
    pip3 install --user pyembed-markdown
    pip3 install --user mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
    ```

!!! warning "How to install system-wide as root (not recommended)"
    ```sh
    pip3 install mkdocs
    pip3 install mkdocs-material
    pip3 install pyembed-markdown
    pip3 install mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
    ```

!!! help "How to upgrade (as a user)"
    Make sure you are using **mkdocs version 0.17.2+**.
    ```sh
    pip3 install -U --user mkdocs
    pip3 install -U --user mkdocs-material
    pip3 install -U --user pyembed-markdown
    pip3 install -U --user mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin
    ```

## Recommended editor

Since we use the markdown format, you can use any plain text editor.
However, we suggest to use **[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)**
with the **Markdown Support plugin** (both are free) which gives you:

- syntax highlighting
- path completion of links such as image file names
- refactoring, which is handy when renaming markdown files which are liked from other files
- fancy search
- outline of the document structure
- automated simplified preview (which is not that important due to the mkdocs hot-reload)

## How to edit

Before editing the documentation, start the live-reloading docs server
using `mkdocs serve` within the project root directory.
Then, open the page [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your
browser and watch your edits being reloaded automatically.

    #!sh
    mkdocs serve
    
```
INFO    -  Building documentation... 
INFO    -  Cleaning site directory 
[I 171024 15:03:51 server:283] Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000
[I 171024 15:03:51 handlers:60] Start watching changes
```    

You can now edit the markdown documents within the `docs/` directory.

## Deployment

!!! warning
    This operation is relevant only to the administrators of the `biggis-docs` repository.
    As a regular contributor, you should only preview your local changes and push them to the
    `master` branch or through pull request instead of directly deploying the built docs to the
    `gh-pages `branch.

The deployment is about building the HTML version out of the markdown sources from
the `master` git branch and and pushing the generated content to the `gh-pages` branch.
Github then makes this new version available online.

The responsible person then uses the command `mkdocs gh-deploy` to generate a static [Docs Website]
and deploy it automatically as a github page (served from `gh-pages` branch).

!!! info
    The newly deployed version appears after few seconds.
    

## Documentation layout

    mkdocs.yml    # The configuration file.
    docs/
      index.md    # The documentation homepage.
      ...         # Other markdown pages, images and other files.

For the sake of simplicity, we use the following hierarchy inside `docs/`:
 
  - **Level 1** : areas (directories) that appear in the main menu.
  - **Level 2** : pages (markdown files) that appear in the left side bar.
  - **Level 3** : headings (H1, H2, ...) that appear in the table of contents on the right

!!! warning
    Do not use spaces in file names. Replace them with dashes `-` (or alternatively with underscores `_`).
    This allows for easier refactoring because spaces are usually transformed to `%20` in markdown which looks weird.

## Formatting examples

??? summary "Images"

    You can include images into the documentation in the following format:
    
      - **SVG** (scalable vectors).
      - **JPG** (photos)
      - **PNG** (raster graphics)
    
    In contrast to scientific papers, it is not possible to create references to numbered figures in markdown.
    
        ![Image "alt" description](path/to/image.svg)
    
    
    ![Sample image](http://www.gstatic.com/webp/gallery/1.jpg)
    
    See also http://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/writing-your-docs/#images-and-media
    
    !!! note
        When editing a file e.g. `path/to/ABC.md`, store all related images in the same
        folder (`path/to/ABC`). This way, different topics are better encapsulated.

??? summary "Figures with caption (on top)"

    You can create images with a nice looking caption and additional description.
    
        !!! info "Figure: Here comes a single line title"
            ![](path/to/image.svg)
            
            Here comes some additional multi-line text.

??? summary "Source Code with Code Highlighting"

    Code can be displayed inline like this:
    
        `print 1+{variable}`
    
    Or it can be displayed in a code block with optional syntax highlighting if the language is specified.
    
        ```python
        def my_function():
            "just a test"
            print 8/2 
        ```
    
    ```python
    def my_function():
        "just a test"
        print 8/2 
    ```
    
    Other useful langauge codes are:
    
      - **sh** : source code written in shell script
      - **console**: commands written to console, e.g.: `$ cat /dev/urandom`
      - **json**: data in JSON format
      - **javascript**: JavaScript source code
